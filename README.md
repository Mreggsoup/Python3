This is a random thing that i have been doing

It's not really a virus it just makes a huge file using a list 
of course you can cancel useing CTRL + C


#1 you need to have python3 installed 

In your terminal run: python3 virus.py

the fakewifihack python file fakes a wifi hack and then gives you a random string
